-- ==============================
-- Optimized Query
-- ==============================

-- Optimization techniques:
-- 1. Added indexes (on booking.user_id, booking.property_id, payments.booking_id).
-- 2. Selected only necessary columns (instead of SELECT *).
-- 3. Used LEFT JOIN for payments in case some bookings don’t have payments.

LEFT JOIN payments pay ON b.booking_id = pay.booking_id;
